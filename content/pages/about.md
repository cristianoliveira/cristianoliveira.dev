I have a passion for web development, mobile and entrepreneurship. That's why I've majored in Information Systems Administration and I've been participating in open source projects. I always try to be well informed and read as much as I can about the area.
I am from Brazil currently working in Berlin. I’ve been working as a software developer for over 9 years. I’ve worked at Globo.com which is the biggest Media company in Brazil with a lot of projects and interesting UI problems. Currently, working at SumUp, the leading financial technology company and we are currently scaling apps to more than 32 countries facing a lot of cool challenges. :)

Main know how:

- Javascript
- Ruby
- Golang
