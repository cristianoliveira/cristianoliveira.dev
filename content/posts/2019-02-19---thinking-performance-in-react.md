description: 'Some time ago I and my friends were talking about how unit testings made our lives as developers much more simple and enjoyable. Then one of them said he used to not do any kind of automated test and he was happy with that. You know what? There is no problem with that, if it works for him thatâ€™s great.'

# React to the need for speed - (Post pos talk)

## Defining performance
Performance is a broad topic and it can be looked from different perspectives Loading, User Interaction and Smooth Animation. There are many variables that impact your app. The problems with those variables are you don't have control over it, especially on the web. That makes tackling performance tricky because you don't know which browser, 
CPU nor network your app is going to run on and usually you are blind due to the environment 
you develop your apps. Usually, we work with top-notch machines and high-speed internet.

## Why performance isn't a first-class feature?
There are a variety of reasons that we can notice. We as developers look to provide the most enjoyable and fast product but we have to ask our selves: Are we optimizing to the right public? For instance, if your market is focused in Europe/USA you probably don't have to care much, at least in the beginning, about loading time since the average internet connection is pretty decent accordingly with Speedtest website (https://www.speedtest.net/global-index).

The performance metrics and actions should be aligned with the business that makes the companies effort to benefit more people this essential especially for startups where the resources usually are scarce.
