Some time ago I and my friends were talking about how unit testings made our lives as developers much more
simple and enjoyable. Then one of them said he used to not do any kind of automated test and
he was happy with that. You know what? There is no problem with that, if it works for him that’s great.

So afterwards we joked about how unit testing your code is like brushing your teeth. No one is gonna
force you to do so, it’s just a good habit, but don’t expect having a healthy mouth after some time.
